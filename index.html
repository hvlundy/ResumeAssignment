                    <h2>Fine Art Photographer - Hobbyist</h2>

                        <p> Hello, my name is Hannele Lundy I fell in love with photography and photo manipulation due to the limitless possibilities of the medium. Photography started as a way to express myself but has evolved into deeper visual narratives to ignite emotions and wonder in a surreal atmosphere.</p>

                        <p>My work is often inspired by my own life experiences but also by poetry, short stories, paintings and nature. Each image starts as a concept sketch that undergoes several revisions before the idea speaks to me. From there I decide which components of the image should be a physical effect in the photograph and which will be manipulated into the photo.</p>
                    
                        <p>The finishing touches to my creations are textures and brushes applied to yield a surreal and painterly look. My visual style is often dark and moody with a surreal twist, which is completely different from my personality. I feel very connected with darkness because it has always been part of my life and through art I found a way to channel it into something beautiful.</p>
